#' @description
#'
#' `CytoMDS` implements a low dimensional visualization of a set of cytometry 
#' samples, in order to visually assess the 'distances' between them.
#' This, in turn, can greatly help the user to identify quality issues 
#' like batch effects or outlier samples, and/or check the presence of 
#' potential sample clusters that might align with the experimental design.  
#'   
#' The CytoMDS algorithm combines, on the one hand, 
#' the concept of Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a.k.a. Wasserstein metric 
#' and, on the other hand, the Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm 
#' for the low dimensional projection.  
#' 
#' Also, the package provides some diagnostic tools for 
#' both checking the quality of the MDS projection, 
#' as well as tools to help with the interpretation of 
#' the axes of the projection.
