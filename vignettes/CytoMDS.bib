              stress and functions which majorize stress are elaborated. This
              strategy to solve MDS problems is called SMACOF and it is
              implemented in an R package of the same name which is presented
              in this article. We extend the basic SMACOF theory in terms of
              configuration constraints, three-way data, unfolding models, and
              projection of the resulting configurations onto spheres and other
              quadratic surfaces. Various examples are presented to show the

              have become a method of choice for high-throughput interrogation

              updated R-based pipeline for differential analyses of HDCyto
              data, largely based on Bioconductor packages. We computationally
              define cell populations using FlowSOM clustering, and facilitate
              an optional but reproducible strategy for manual merging of
              algorithm-generated clusters. Our workflow offers different
              analysis paths, including association of cell type abundance with
              a phenotype or changes in signalling markers within specific
              subpopulations, or differential analyses of aggregated signals.
              Importantly, the differential analyses we show are based on
              regression frameworks where the HDCyto data is the response;
              thus, we are able to model arbitrary experimental designs, such
              as those with batch effects, paired designs and so on. In
              particular, we apply generalized linear mixed models or linear
              mixed models to analyses of cell population abundance or
              cell-population-specific analyses of signaling markers, allowing
              overdispersion in cell count or aggregated signals across samples
              to be appropriately modeled. To support the formal statistical
              analyses, we encourage exploratory data analysis at every step,
              including quality control (e.g., multi-dimensional scaling
              plots), reporting of clustering results (dimensionality
              reduction, heatmaps with dendrograms) and differential analyses
              (e.g., plots of aggregated signals).",
