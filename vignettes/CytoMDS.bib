		  collaborative creation of extensible software for
		  computational biology and bioinformatics. The goals
		  of the project include: fostering collaborative
		  development and widespread use of innovative
		  software, reducing barriers to entry into
		  interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting
		  the achievement of remote reproducibility of
		  research results. We describe details of our aims
		  and methods, identify current challenges, compare
		  Bioconductor to other open bioinformatics projects,
		  and provide working examples.},

  abstract = "In this paper we present the methodology of multidimensional
              scaling problems (MDS) solved by means of the majorization
              algorithm. The objective function to be minimized is known as
              stress and functions which majorize stress are elaborated. This
              strategy to solve MDS problems is called SMACOF and it is
              implemented in an R package of the same name which is presented
              in this article. We extend the basic SMACOF theory in terms of
              configuration constraints, three-way data, unfolding models, and
              projection of the resulting configurations onto spheres and other
              quadratic surfaces. Various examples are presented to show the
              possibilities of the SMACOF approach offered by the corresponding
              package.",
